The interplay of attentional and neuromodulatory reward signals is hypothesized to cause these behavioral and associated neuronal changes, although VPL can occur without attention (i.e., task-irrelevant VPL). In addition, task-relevant VPL can be category-selective for simple attended oriented stimuli. Yet, it is unclear whether category-selective task-irrelevant VPL occurs and which brain centers mediate underlying forms of adult cortical plasticity. Here, we show that pairing subliminal complex visual stimuli (faces and bodies) with electrical microstimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-EM) causes category-selective task-irrelevant VPL. These perceptual improvements are accompanied by fMRI signal changes in early and late visual and frontal areas, as well as the cerebellum, hippocampus, claustrum, and putamen. In conclusion, Pavlovian pairing of unattended complex stimuli with VTA-EM causes category-selective learning accompanied by changes of cortical and subcortical neural representations in macaques.","tags":[],"title":"Electrical stimulation of the macaque ventral tegmental area drives category-selective learning without attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajani Raman","Haruo Hosoya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"39e364f590e72980b129cb777315406f","permalink":"/publication/commbio/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T04:43:24.008077Z","relpermalink":"/publication/commbio/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent computational studies have emphasized layer-wise quantitative similarity between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the primate visual ventral stream. However, whether such similarity holds for the face-selective areas, a subsystem of the higher visual cortex, is not clear. Here, we extensively investigate whether CNNs exhibit tuning properties as previously observed in different macaque face areas. While simulating four past experiments on a variety of CNN models, we sought for the model layer that quantitatively matches the multiple tuning properties of each face area. Our results show that higher model layers explain reasonably well the properties of anterior areas, while no layer simultaneously explains the properties of middle areas, consistently across the model variation. Thus, some similarity may exist between CNNs and the primate face-processing system in the near-goal representation, but much less clearly in the intermediate stages, thus requiring alternative modeling such as non-layer-wise correspondence or different computational principles. Rajani Raman and Haruo Hosoya examined layer-wise similarities between convolutional neural networks and the face-processing areas of the macaque visual cortex. They show that higher model layers exhibit similar tuning properties of anterior areas, such as strong invariance properties in size and view, while intermediate areas were more difficult to model.","tags":null,"title":"Convolutional neural networks explain tuning properties of anterior, but not middle, face-processing areas in macaque inferotemporal cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajani Raman","Sandip Sarkar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dbe1442e8f524e6eab32903c2328b907","permalink":"/publication/scientifc_reports/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T04:43:24.009068Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scientifc_reports/","section":"publication","summary":"Psychophysical experiments reveal our horizontal preference in perceptual filling-in at the blind spot. On the other hand, tolerance in filling-in exhibit vertical preference. What causes this anisotropy in our perception? Building upon the general notion that the functional properties of the early visual system are shaped by the innate specification as well as the statistics of the environment, we reasoned that the anisotropy in filling-in could be understood in terms of anisotropy in orientation distribution inherent in natural scene statistics. We examined this proposition by investigating filling-in of bar stimuli in a Hierarchical Predictive Coding model network. The model network, trained with natural images, exhibited anisotropic filling-in performance at the blind spot, which is similar to the findings of psychophysical experiments. We suggest that the over-representation of horizontal contours in the natural scene contributes to the observed horizontal superiority in filling-in and the broader distribution of vertical contours contributes to the observed vertical superiority of tolerance in filling-in. These results indicate that natural scene statistics plays a significant role in determining the filling-in performance at the blind spot and shaping the associated anisotropies.","tags":null,"title":"Significance of Natural Scene Statistics in Understanding the Anisotropies of Perceptual Filling-in at the Blind Spot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajani Raman","Sandip Sarkar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"f1176fe7851c8c3ba1ce22d2cfa82376","permalink":"/publication/plosone/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T04:43:24.009542Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plosone/","section":"publication","summary":"Filling-in at the blind spot is a perceptual phenomenon in which the visual system fills the informational void, which arises due to the absence of retinal input corresponding to the optic disc, with surrounding visual attributes. It is known that during filling-in, nonlinear neural responses are observed in the early visual area that correlates with the perception, but the knowledge of underlying neural mechanism for filling-in at the blind spot is far from complete. In this work, we attempted to present a fresh perspective on the computational mechanism of filling-in process in the framework of hierarchical predictive coding, which provides a functional explanation for a range of neural responses in the cortex. We simulated a three-level hierarchical network and observe its response while stimulating the network with different bar stimulus across the blind spot. We find that the predictive-estimator neurons that represent blind spot in primary visual cortex exhibit elevated non-linear response when the bar stimulated both sides of the blind spot. Using generative model, we also show that these responses represent the filling-in completion. All these results are consistent with the finding of psychophysical and physiological studies. In this study, we also demonstrate that the tolerance in filling-in qualitatively matches with the experimental findings related to non-aligned bars. We discuss this phenomenon in the predictive coding paradigm and show that all our results could be explained by taking into account the efficient coding of natural images along with feedback and feed-forward connections that allow priors and predictions to co-evolve to arrive at the best prediction. These results suggest that the filling-in process could be a manifestation of the general computational principle of hierarchical predictive coding of natural images.","tags":null,"title":"Predictive Coding: A Possible Explanation of Filling-In at the Blind Spot","type":"publication"}]
